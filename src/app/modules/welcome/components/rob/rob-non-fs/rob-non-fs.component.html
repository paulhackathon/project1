    <p>
				Forest Service (FS) cooperators, volunteers, contractors, and other associates are granted access to information resources in order to facilitate their Forest Service related responsibilities. FS associates must understand and agree to their Information Security Responsibilities to be allowed access to information systems.		
				</p>
				<p>
				I understand that I must comply with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) policies and procedures, and with federal, state, and local laws. I understand that as an FS associate, I may not be entitled to the same limited personal use privileges as FS employees, and that my use of FS information systems and equipment is limited to that which is specifically described in my contract or other agreement with the Forest Service.
				</p>
				<p>
				I understand that my contract or other agreement may specify additional information security responsibilities or requirements, such as the need for a signed confidentiality statement.
				</p>
				<p>
				Key elements of FSM Chapter 6680, for which I am responsible, are summarized above. I understand and agree that I must periodically review the chapter for changes:
				</p>
				<p>
				 http://www.fs.fed.us/cgi-bin/Directives/get_dirs/fsm?6600!.		
				</p>
				<p>
				I am also responsible to: 
				</p>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<p>
				Take appropriate measures to protect information from unauthorized access, including seeking out and applying security measures to protect sensitive information stored on my computer, on other electronic devices, or on other media such as CDs, DVDs, magnetic tape, and paper (FSM 6683.04f).
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Not store any classified information on my computer.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Encrypt, using agency authorized encryption methods, any government sensitive or confidential information or information subject to the Privacy Act that is stored on any personal electronic device or removable storage medium.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Sign off or electronically lock the computer before leaving it unattended (FSM 6683.04f)
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Comply with physical security standards and procedures specified in section 6683.15a of FSM Chapter 6680, including taking appropriate measures to protect computer equipment and other electronic devices from theft, damage, or unauthorized use.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Comply with password standards and procedures specified in section FSM 6684.12, and FSM 6684.12, Exhibit 1 of Interim Directive 6680-2005-3.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Verify that the automatic virus definition file updates to the enterprise antivirus tool (currently, Symantec AntiVirus) occur as scheduled (FSM 6683.04f).
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Store corporate data within the corporate filing system, where it is backed up routinely (FSM 6683.04f). The FS defines corporate data as information owned, collected, maintained, or generated by the enterprise that has inherent value to and is intended for consistent, shared use within the enterprise. (FSM 6680.5).
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Install only that software for which I have obtained authorization, and when my privileges are elevated to allow installation of authorized software to perform only those activities that are specifically authorized (FSM 6683.04f).
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Refrain from installing on FS computer equipment any software, including freeware and shareware, that does not have technical approval from the Chief Information Office (FSM 6683.15h).
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Be aware of the proper procedures for the sanitization and disposal of Agency information and data. Users shall be aware that data can be retrieved from media (diskettes, tapes, hard drives, or other memory devices) even after being erased or deleted. To properly sanitize media of residual data, users must contact the Helpdesk for assistance in degaussing, overwriting, or otherwise ensuring media is purged prior to disposal.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Being aware of retention and disposal requirements of data to which I have access privileges.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Ensure that Agency sensitive information to which I have access is securely maintained, disseminated, and protected from disclosure, release, or extraction to unauthorized individuals or groups. In the instance of information protected by specific laws, such as the Privacy Act or the Health Insurance Privacy and Portability Act (HIPPA), users must be aware of the confidentiality protection procedures required of them in their handling of agency sensitive data as required by law.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Not remove hardware containing Agency sensitive information from FS without following appropriate media protection (encryption) or sanitization and disposal (overwriting, degaussing) procedures.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Take FS computer equipment from a FS facility only for official business purposes.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Only use computer equipment for which I have authorization.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Not move or install computer equipment unless I am an authorized technician and the action has been approved by the appropriate IT System Owner or supervisor.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Ensure if I am working remotely (those who operate portable computer systems in an alternate workplace, e.g., cell phone, PDA (Blackberry), or home computers), I take the same precautions as required of users of stationary systems located at FS facilities to protect the FS systems, hardware, software, and information.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Ensure if I am working remotely to follow the remote access requirements, which may include two-factor authentication and additional restrictions on portable computer systems to ensure these devices do not compromise the integrity or confidentiality of FS information or data.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Not change the configuration settings or attempt to modify or disable any of the security programs installed on their FS information system, including virus protection software and the password protected screen saver.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Ensure all software in use by a user on FS equipment must have a valid license on file with purchasing.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Promptly report all suspected security incidents to the FS Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT@FSNOTES) and/or my supervisor or other appropriate management official(s) (FSM 6683.04f).
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Understand findings of culpability will result in disciplinary action consistent with the provisions of FSM 6170 and DPM 751, which may include the employees loss of use or limitations on use of equipment, disciplinary or adverse action, criminal penalties, and/or financial liability for the cost of improper use.			</p>
				
				</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
						Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any piece of information which can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, locate, or impersonate a single person. If I have access to PII, I am responsible to:
					</p>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<p>
				Never access PII unless absolutely necessary to perform my job.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Never disclose PII to another person within FS unless that individual has verified that he/she is entitled to the information.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Never remove PII from FS premises unless it is encrypted using a FS-approved method unless I have a copy of a memorandum waiving the encryption requirement that has been signed by a Business Unit Manager and that applies to this circumstance.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Verify that any time I extract PII from an information system into a computer readable form (e.g., into a spreadsheet or report), that the act of doing so has been properly logged so that the location of the PII can be tracked.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Ensure that after having finished using any extracted PII, or after 90 days, whichever comes first, I will erase the PII or receive written permission from my supervisor to retain it for a longer term.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Ensure that when I erase PII, the act of doing so is properly logged so that the location of the PII will no longer be tracked.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Never access PII from computers or devices outside of FS premises without advance authorization for remote access.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Never attempt remote access without using approved FS access methods, which generally require the use of a SecurID device (called a token).
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Never store my token with or near a laptop or other portable computer that contains PII or is used for PII access.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Never mark my token with any information such as name or password.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Promptly report any possible, suspected, or actual loss of PII or any device containing PII to the appropriate point of contact. I must know how to make a report. I must keep a record of the reporting to the point of contact separate from any device, so that the point of contact can make a report if the device is missing.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Report any possible, suspected, or actual loss of PII or any device containing PII within 15 minutes of discovery of the incident, regardless of the time of day.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Physically secure all portable devices containing PII. I will lock up laptops using a cable lock when they are not in use, including when they are within my home, vehicle, or hotel room. I will lock small devices into secure containers when they are not in my possession.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Encrypt PII when it is placed onto removable media such as CDs, thumb drives or memory sticks and when it is removed from agency premises.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>
				Ensure that if PII is lost or stolen, it is reported to the Helpdesk within 24 hours.
				</p>
				
				</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				I understand that if I have been granted authorization to use my own or my organizations computer equipment, I must complete and sign (or a representative of my organization must complete and sign on my behalf) the <b>FS Standards for Associate-Owned PCs Used for Forest Service Work and Connected to the FS Network</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
						I understand that any use of Forest Service communications resources generally is not secure, is not private, and is not anonymous, and that system managers employ monitoring tools to detect improper use (FSM 6683.15i). I understand that there is no right to privacy when using government information systems (logon warning banner).
